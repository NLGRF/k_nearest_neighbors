# K-Nearest Neighbors Classification from Scratch with NumPy

This repository contains implementation for k-nearest neighbor classification algorithm using python, only with numpy package.

Moreover, class implementation for k-nearest neighbor algorithm, which helps the user to use the implementation as a module, is added.
